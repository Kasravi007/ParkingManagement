# üÖøÔ∏è Parking Management System

This is a **console-based Parking Management System** developed in **C#**, designed to simulate a basic parking lot that handles **vehicle entry**, **exit**, **slot assignment**, and **billing**. This system is ideal for small to medium-sized parking lot management.

## üöó Features

- Add vehicles with details (number, type)
- Assign the nearest available parking slot
- Track parked vehicles
- Handle vehicle exit and release slots
- Calculate parking duration and charges
- Display available and occupied slots

- Clean and interactive command-line interface

## üìã How It Works

### 1. On Startup
The application initializes the parking lot with a fixed number of slots (configurable). Each slot has a unique **slot number**.

### 2. Main Menu Options
The console shows the following options:


### 3. Park Vehicle
